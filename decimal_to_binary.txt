Here's an example of converting a decimal number with fractional components to binary:

Let's say we want to convert the decimal number 13.625 to binary. We can separate the integer and fractional components and convert them separately.

Integer part:

13 / 2 = 6, remainder 1
6 / 2 = 3, remainder 0
3 / 2 = 1, remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0, remainder 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary equivalent of the integer part is 1101.

Fractional part:

Multiply the fractional part by 2 and separate the integer and fractional components:

0.625 * 2 = 1.25, integer part 1
0.25 * 2 = 0.5, integer part 0
0.5 * 2 = 1.0, integer part 1

Reading the integer parts from top to bottom, the binary equivalent of the fractional part is 101.

Combining the binary equivalent of the integer and fractional parts, we get:

13.625 in decimal = 1101.101 in binary
